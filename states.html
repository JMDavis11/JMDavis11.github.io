    <h1>Jace's State Websites Review</h1>
    <p>Below you will find links to each states' website.</p>
    
    <h2>State of Iowa: <a href="https://directory.iowa.gov/">iowa.gov</a>         (Personal Favorite)</h2>
    <p>Iowa's website is my favorite because of the simple yet accessible look. The top bar provides links to services, agencies, and social services along with a search bar. There is another interactive search bar in the middle of the homepage which allows users easy access to whatever information they may need. The colors are simple, with the main backgroud colors of blue and white. The website loads very quickly and it also works well in multiple screen sizes.</p>
    
    <h2>State of Vermont: <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">vermont.gov</a></h2>
    <p>Vermont's website is very appealing to the eye as there are many pictures of the beautiful Vermont landscapes across the website. The menu bar is very simple, and offers quick links to the other pages along with a search bar. The website is designed for a scrolling and I think that is very smart as it seems to be more compatible with mobile devices and multiple screen sizes. The bottom of the home page offers links to state news along with personal information of the state officials.  </p>
    
    <h2>State of Tennessee: <a href="https://www.tn.gov/">tn.gov</a></h2>
    <p>Tennessee's website has very good design to it. The scrolling menu at the beginning offers users the chance to browse general categories of information if they do not know the exact information that they need. The box menu below that offers more direct categories that users can easily find information from. I think the colors of the website could be a little more bright and upbeat and less government like. The website seems to load very quickly and easily adapts to multiple screen sizes.</p>
    
    <h2>State of Alaska: <a href="https://alaska.gov/">alaska.gov</a></h2>
    <p>Alaska's website seems overloaded with lists of information that do not have a very easy user interface for accessibility. There is major information, such as Fish and Game, that is in very small font towards the bottom of the page. With the popularity of fishing and hunting in the state, I think the link should be more easily recognizable. The structure of the website seems to be ok, but I think the overall design and colors of the website need to be updated, and the information needs to be congregated into more easily-accessible links.</p>
    
    <h2>State of Oklahoma: <a href="https://www.ok.gov">ok.gov</a> (Least Favorite)</h2>
    <p>Oklahoma's website does not appear like it has been updated in many, many years. The navigation and advanced search bars are hidden in the search bar at top and are not easily recognizable as website tools. There is little to no information on the main homepage, and it appears that finding information is a task in itself. The colors are very bland, and the design of the website stacks information on top of each other. The website does seem to adapt to multiple screen sizes, and loads rather quickly, but that is about the extent of the positives for ol' Oklahoma.</p>
