    <h1>Website Opinions</h1>
    <p>Here is my take on two websites that are constructed well, Fanatics and Adidas, and one website that I do not think is constructed well but has potential, Bob's Auto Mart.</p>
    
    <h2>Good Website #1: <a href="https://www.fanatics.com/">Fanatics</a>       </h2>
    <p>Fanatics is an online retail store that sells sports apparel and fan gear. They offer products from many different brands and nearly every sport out there. I like this site because it is very easy to find the products you are looking for. The layout is simple with links in the header to the different sections of the store (sports leagues). The headers, when hovered over, then display a list of all of the different sports teams in the leagues with their logo next to their name for easy finding. There is an easily accessible search bar at the top in the center that just increases accessibility across the site. When looking at the code, they do use HTML elements and the code is very modern and organized. A large portion of their code is img elements as they use many pictures as well as team logos throughout their entire website. They use table elements to form some of their graphics, such as a clickable table with logos of each major sports organization. The layout is quite simple, with the home page being single column with images spreading the width of the page. As I mentioned earlier, the website is very easy to maneuver, with clickable links for every sports team and league. These links make it easy to first find the team you are looking for, and then the products once you get to those lists! The site uses many different colors in their pictures, but I would consider the main colors to be red, white, and blue. I think these colors are attractive as they symbolize the greatest nation and the sports that we are blessed to be able to use for entertainment. The site uses quite a bit of white space which makes it easy to read and separate information. I also like how they don’t use the same format for each page, but instead vary them with images, tables, and clickable links. </p>
    
    <h2>Good Website #2: <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us">Adidas</a></h2>
    <p>Adidas is another apparel and shoe store that uses their website to sell their items. I like this website because it matches the Adidas brand and their casual style. They use many bright colors in their images that attract the eye very easily, and they also use a lot of white space to contrast the image colors against the background of the site. There is a hamburger menu on the top left of the header, which I don’t like, but there is an easily identifiable search button which helps customers find a product they may be directly searching for. The code is in html, and is made up mostly of img elements as they showcase their clothing and shoes through these elements. I do not notice the use of any tables, but I did notice the lists in the code in which they can categorize their clothing and shoes by gender, size, sport, etc. The layout of the site is very simple, and is clearly set up for scrolling. There is a chat box in the lower right corner of the screen that is clear and vivid if consumers have a question. The site is laid out as most retail outlets are, with special events (sales) at the top, new products as you scroll down, and then categories of items as you get farther down the site. It is very easy to navigate, and there are multiple starting points that can lead you to your desired product category. The main colors of the site are black and white, which fit the simplistic tone of Adidas and their company colors. The bright colors of images even further match Adidas as they have recently been trying to differentiate their products through bright colors and hipster(ish) designs. I really like how this site uses whitespace to spread out their products. The white makes the site look very clean and separates information very effectively.   </p>
    
    <h2>Bad Website: <a href="https://www.bobsautomart.com/">Bob's Auto Mart</a></h2>
    <p> Bob’s Auto Mart is a used car and truck dealership located in the greatest town in Montana, Lewistown. However, their site needs some work. I dislike this website because it is very blocky. There is no continuity to it, and it seems to be very organized. Their logo at the top of the page takes up very little room, and most people would probably browse right over it. They have a hamburger menu with only four links attached which would be way better as a header bar with icons. They have an image at the top of the screen that flashes new trucks and cars, which they don’t sell, but then have click-through images further down the screen of cars that they actually do have in inventory. The search bar is pretty far down the screen and hard to find. The other information and filters for finding a vehicle are even further down the screen. The code for the website is in HTML, but they do not use tables. Their code is not very organized, and it is apparent why all of the information is stacked on top of each other. As you may have noticed earlier, I do not like the layout of this website. They have the opportunity to link all of the information into a menu format, but instead chose to use a scrolling option that does not work well for their products. I think this site needs to be completely revamped in the style department. It is very hard to navigate as most of the information is stacked right on top of each other and would be hard to isolate unless you were to really look for the information. The colors are yellow and red which do match their company logo, but I do not think they are very effective in how they used the colors. Some buttons have those colors, while others just have white and black buttons. There is a lot of white space, but it is not used effectively. Instead, the lack of white space allows too much information to be stacked on each other. Overall, this website has all of the information it needs, and the potential to be a great website. However, many style elements need to be used in order for this to happen. </p>
